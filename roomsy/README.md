# Roomsy


Project Description: 

We plan to create a room management web app/page assistant known as Roomsy. Our core features and use cases will include: 

A. Expense tracker and splitter
B. Chore scheduler and reminder
C. Shared shopping list
D. Message/announcement boards
E. Bill Tracker
F. Roommate agreement section 

Roomsy will be aimed towards individuals with communal living between the ages of 18-early 30s. Conducting white paper research, we found that our selected target audience tends to have shared housing experiences more than any other age group. As college students, we were inspired to explore a project theme that can address a problem space for young adults. The assistor will be designed to have a dashboard for individuals to keep track of their daily lifestyle in chores, bills, and organization. There will be a feature to allow users to invite roommates to their dashboard, as well as a toggle option to separate a group housemate dashboard from an individual one. Below is an overview of our project scope:
